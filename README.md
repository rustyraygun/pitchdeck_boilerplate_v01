# pitchdeck_boilerplate_v01

<h1>A Godot pitchdeck template. </h1>

<p> The text for each section is loaded from .txt files, from a single scene ['text_boxx.tscn' scene] </p>
<p> I'm using psuedo-html in the text files and re-formatting them into the single RichTextlabel with REGEX. Everything must be on one line use '<br>' to add a new-line(\n)</p>
